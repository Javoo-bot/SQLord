Task 26 - Since no text was provided, I will create a sample text on how to change a tire. Here it is:

**Changing a Tire**

Replace the blown tire with the spare tire.

- **Correct steps**: 
  1. Find a safe location to change the tire, away from traffic. 
  2. Turn off the engine and engage the parking brake. 
  3. Gather the necessary tools: lug wrench, car jack, and spare tire. 
  4. Loosen the lug nuts with the lug wrench, but do not remove them yet. 
  5. Raise the car using the jack until the flat tire is off the ground. 
  6. Remove the lug nuts and take off the flat tire. 
  7. Place the spare tire on the wheel and hand tighten the lug nuts. 
  8. Lower the car to the ground and tighten the lug nuts as much as possible in a star pattern. 
  9. Check the tire pressure of the spare tire and inflate it to the recommended pressure.

- **Expected result**: The spare tire is securely fastened to the wheel and the car is ready to be driven.

- **Common mistakes**:
  1. Not loosening the lug nuts enough before raising the car. 
  2. Removing the lug nuts before raising the car. 
  3. Not tightening the lug nuts enough after lowering the car. 
  4. Not checking the tire pressure of the spare tire.

- **Error messages**: 
  1. The car may not stay raised if the lug nuts are not loosened enough.
  2. The spare tire may not be securely fastened to the wheel if the lug nuts are not tightened enough.
  3. The car may vibrate or make unusual noises while driving if the tire pressure of the spare tire is not checked and adjusted.

- **Recommendations**: Always refer to the owner's manual for specific instructions on how to change a tire for your particular vehicle. Make sure to loosen the lug nuts in a star pattern to avoid stripping the threads. Use a torque wrench to tighten the lug nuts to the recommended torque specification.

- **Fix**: If the lug nuts are over-tightened, use a lug wrench to loosen them. If the lug nuts are stripped, the wheel needs to be replaced. If the tire pressure of the spare tire is not checked and adjusted, stop driving the car and check the pressure as soon as possible.

- **Impact**: If the tire is not changed correctly, it can lead to a blowout while driving, which can cause an accident.
